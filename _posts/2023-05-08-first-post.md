Welcome to the blog! I don't really have any posts planned yet, but hope to eventually use this to occasionally share research updates, evolutionary/statistical musings, and R tutorials/code snippets, among whatever else.

<!--more-->

Over the course of my PhD, I have found that it can take a shockingly short amount of time to implement statistical methods compared to the amount of time it takes to fully document those methods and make them accessible. Accordingly, I thought it would be nice to have something similar to Liam Revell's [Phylogenetic Tools for Comparative Biology](http://blog.phytools.org/) blog where I respond to questions about how to use my software and provide tutorials for methods I have yet to publish/document.

In any case, that's really all I have for now--thanks for visiting my website!
