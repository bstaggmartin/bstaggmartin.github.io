Hi there! I'm currently a postdoc at University of Georgia in the Department of Plant Biology, working with <a href="https://www.jlmlab.com/">Dr. James Leebens-Mack</a>. Generally speaking, I develop statistical tools for figuring out what factors cause evolutionary processes to vary over space, time, and taxa. My specialty is continuous trait evolution modeling, with a particular focus on quantifying variation in rates of evolution. Right now, my postdoctoral position is funded by a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology (NSF PRFB) to investigate the genetic basis of life history trait variation across eucalypts.
