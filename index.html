Hi there! I'm currently a Michigan State University PhD candidate in the Department of Plant Biology with <a href="http://www.theweberlab.com/">Marjorie Weber</a>. Generally speaking, I develop statistical tools for figuring out what factors cause evolutionary processes to vary over space, time, and taxa. At the moment, I primarily work on developing new phylogenetic comparative methods for characterizing variation in rates of continuous trait evolution.
