Because all organisms are related via evolution, it follows that the many observed disparities in biodiversity across both space (e.g., tropical versus temperate regions) and taxa (e.g., flowering plants versus conifers) are directly related to differences in evolutionary time and/or rates. More concretely, species richness, genetic diversity, and phenotypic diversity are inextricably linked to the balance of speciation and extinction rates, rates of molecular evolution, and rates of trait evolution, respectively. This may seem rather self-evident in retrospect, but it has a big consequence: accurate and robust quantification of evolutionary rates is absolutely essential to understanding how and why biodiversity is distributed the way it is.

Estimating the rates of evolutionary processes, unfortunately, is not trivial. Ideally, rates would be estimated by tracking how evolving lineages change, speciate, and go extinct over long timespans. However, the regularity of extinction and incompleteness of the fossil record (not to mention our short lifespans) render such direct data extremely rare. In most cases, a more indirect, phylogenetic comparative approach is necessary--essentially, using measurements from living organisms and/or fossils along with information on their evolutionary relationships (usually a phylogeny or "evolutionary tree" inferred from DNA sequence data) to infer evolutionary processes.

Generally speaking, I research and develop new phylogenetic comparative methods that explicitly quantify and/or explain variation in evolutionary processes--especially rates. In addition to more accurately estimating rates in the face of variation in rates across space, time, and taxa (which appears extremely common), such methods will provide insights into what factors accelerate or decelerate evolutionary processes, thereby shaping the tree of life and structuring the distribution of biodiversity across the globe.


## Modeling variation in rates of continuous trait evolution

Rates of trait evolution vary markedly across the tree of life, from adaptive radiations to lineages of 'living fossils', but our tools for characterizing and analyzing this heterogeneity are still lacking in some cases. I develop novel models, approaches, and algorithms to address some of these gaps in the case of modeling continuous trait evolution.
