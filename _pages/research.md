  - title: "Modeling variation in rates of continuous trait evolution"
    url: "/cont_rate_het/"
    excerpt: "Rates of trait evolution vary markedly across the tree of life, from adaptive radiations to lineages of 'living fossils', but our tools for characterizing and analyzing this heterogeneity are still lacking in some cases. I develop novel models, approaches, and algorithms to address some of these gaps in the case of modeling continuous trait evolution."
