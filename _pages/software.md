## R packages for modeling variation in rates of continuous trait evolution

[Read more](/cont_rate_het/){: .btn .btn--primary}

### Evolving rates

A novel approach to modeling continuous trait evolution that allows the rate of evolution itself to gradually "evolve" over time and across lineages (pretty well-developed).

### Continuous stochastic character mapping

A felixible framework for simulating evolutionary histories of continuous variables under all manner of Brownian Motion models (usable, not documented).

[Github repo](https://github.com/bstaggmartin/contsimmap/){: .btn .btn--primary}

### State-dependent character evolution

A new algorithm for fitting models of interdependent evolution among discrete and continuous traits (still a total work in progress--stay tuned).
