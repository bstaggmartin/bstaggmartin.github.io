title: "Macroevolution of Rates and Traits"

Hi there! I'm a PhD candidate in the Department of Plant Biology at Michigan State University advised by Marjorie Weber (who is now at the University of Michigan). Generally speaking, my research aims to develop statistical tools for studying what factors cause evolutionary processes (primarily trait or phenotypic evolution) to vary over space, time, and taxa. At the moment, I primarily work on developing new phylogenetic comparative methods for characterizing variation in rates of continuous trait evolution.
